Test area for new skills

Hello. I'm trying to develop some quantitative and database management skills by learning R, Python, and SQL. In this repo/workspace, I'll be experimenting with existing code as well as attempting to create my own.


Right now, I'm going through the book "Learn Python 3 The Hard Way" by Zed A. Shaw and I will be posting some of my practice codes with study drill answers to this repository.
