# happy_bday makes the program import all the stuff that's within Song,

# happy_bday = Song()
#happy_bday has been initialized as the class and holds the object "Happy birthday"
# that object is represented by 'x' in the argument for init within Song line 22

#print(happy_bday.lyrics) returns: Happy birthday
#lyrics is a variable within the class Song
# which is now initialized as happy_bday so to call it, you'd have to
# make happy_bday call that variable --> happy_bday.lyrics = self.lyrics
# which prints out x, the object within Song as defined in line 28

happy_bday.sing_me_a_song()
#happy_bday(aka the class Song) is calling on its function sing_me_a_song
# which prints each line in happy_bday.lyrics which has been set to x
# which has been defined as the list ["Happy birthday"] in line 28

## "Happy" is a string of 5 characters
## ["Happy"] is a list with the item "happy" in it
